# Introduction

We have IPL match related data including ball-by-ball information from season 2008  to 2017. The objective of this presentation is to highlight some of the important statistics  related to match, players and teams of IPL over the years using the data at hand. 


## Match Statistics

- If we consider all venues of IPL matches across 2008-2017 seasons, more matches were won when the toss winner had decided to field first.
- This statistics changes for individual venues. For example: If we look for Brabourne stadium, the data shows more number of matches were won when toss winning teams chose to bat first.

- Mumbai Indians tops the list of biggest win by 146 runs throughout all seasons (2008 – 2017) closely followed by RCB with a win by 144 runs.
- Also team RCB appears thrice in the top 10 list of biggest wins by runs. This represents team RCB has performed well in batting as compared to others.

- Here instead of showing match level comparison we have shown the distribution of number of matches won by wickets.
- If we look at the distribution, most number of matches were won by 7 wickets which gradually fell as the team started to lose more wickets.
- Up until the first 3-4 wickets the partnership among batsmen is strong leading to a higher chance of winning the match. This chance seems to weaken as more number of wickets fall. Also losing wickets builds up pressure on the team, which also affects the performance.

- RCB seems to have scored the highest runs of 263 in a single match across all seasons.
- RCB holds 4 positions in the top 10 list of highest runs across season. It implies RCB’s great potential of batting scores.

## Conclusion

With the help of these visualisations one can draw important insights from the past data and utilise those inferences to take informative decision.  They can also be useful in increasing efficiency  as one could retrospect their action and results in the past.

For example , as we saw, in Brabourne stadium the number of matches won were the highest when the toss winning team decided to bat first. This could be an important insight for teams to take a decision in future while playing at Brabourne stadium. Similarly we saw RCB team has performed pretty good at batting in the past seasons. This information could be useful for other teams to plan their strategy in a better way.

The visualisation also answers certain questions like who scored the maximum runs, who took the most wickets in a particular season or how many times a team won a match in a season etc.
